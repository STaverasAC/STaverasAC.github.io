# Introduction to Machine Learning 


## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is the process by which a computer learns and enhances a skill through extensive repetition. 
Tom Mitchell defined machine learning as "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. "

|Variable       | Example|        
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| E  | Playing a chess game hundreds of times |
| T   | Chess game skill level | 
| P | Probability of winning game  |


## Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

#### Supervised and Unsupervised learning are two common machine learning algorithms.

### Supervised Learning

In a supervised learning algorithm the correct answer is found in the data provided. For example given a table of flower types and petal widths
