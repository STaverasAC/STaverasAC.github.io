title: Introduction!

  As a Geographic Information Science graduate, I was exposed to the limitations that one faces when they are reliant on currently available technology or software. I learned that many times, you have to build it yourself. Enter Python. I took an Introduction to Programming for Everybody course offered by the CS department my senior year and then became enamored with the doors that development has the possibility of opening. Python became the go to solution for many problems in my workplace from creating custom tools for ESRI's GIS software to automating common tasks. Now I have began a journey to become a software developer as a fellow in Coalition 4 Queens' Access Code 4 Android Cohort.
  Intelligent people have often suggested that a blog can serve as a tool to cement knowledge I feel that I understand and also as a valuable addition to a resume. I make it a habit to listen to intelligent people so here I am.
