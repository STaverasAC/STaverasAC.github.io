title: Are school bus drivers logging events as they happen? 
---

## Question

The Office of Pupil Transportation is developing a mobile application to inform guardians of the location of their child's bus and the estimated arrival time of that bus to their pick up and drop off location. In order to provide guardians with ETAs, it is necessary for drivers to log ridership events such as arrival and departure from stops as they happen. Given that ridership data and GPS data exists as separate entities unaware of one another, I developed a script to determine if arrival events were being logged at locations of student and school stops.
